# 🌦️ The Lord of Weather

This project was developed as part of **The Odin Project** curriculum.

## 🇺🇾 Special Tribute
This project is a humble **tribute to Nubel Cisneros**, the master of weather forecasting in Uruguay. Because no forecast is truly valid unless it comes with his seal of quality.

## Live Demo
